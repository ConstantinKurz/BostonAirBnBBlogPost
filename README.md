# NYBnBBlogPost

## Installation

All results can be obtained by simply running the notebook `NYBlogPost`. Note that matplotlib 3.3.2, pandas 1.1.3, seaborn 0.11.0, sklearn 0.23.2 and numpy 1.19.2 have been used to create the notebook and the 
[AirBNB NY Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) should be present.

The packages can be installed by running the following pip commands:

```
pip install -U matplotlib@3.3.2 pandas@1.1.3 seaborn@0.11.0 scikit-learn@0.23.2 numpy@1.19.2
```


## Motivation

The Notebook and corresponding blog post have been created in context of the udacity datascience nanodegree. 
The task was to get some insight from an arbitrary dataset ( I choosed the 2019 [AirBNB NY Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) ).
